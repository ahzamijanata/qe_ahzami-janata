There are two ways to solve this, maybe the question could be modified to say the 5 litre can doesn't fit under the tap...

Number 1
- Fill the 5 litre can from the tap
- Empty the 5 litre can into the 3 litre can - leaving 2 litres in the 5 litre can.
- Pour away the contents of the 3 litre can.
- Fill the 3 litre can with the 2 litres from the 5 litre can - leaving 2 litres in the 3 litre can.
- Fill the 5 litre can from the tap.
- Fill the remaining 1 litre space in the 3 litre can from the 5 litre can.
- Leaving 4 litres in the 5 litre can.

Number 2
- Fill the 3 litre can from the tap.
- Empty the contents of the 3 litre can into the 5 litre can.
- Fill the 3 litre can from the tap.
- Empty the contents of the 3 litre can into the 5 litre can. - Leaving the 5 litre can full and 1 litre in the 3 litre can.
- Pour away the contents of the 5 litre can
- Pour the 1 litre from the 3 litre can into the 5 litre can.
- Fill the 3 litre can from the tap.
- Empty the contents of the 3 litre can into the 5 litre can.
- Leaving 4 litres in the 5 litre can.
